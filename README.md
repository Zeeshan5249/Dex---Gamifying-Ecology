# Dex - Gamifying Ecology ðŸŒ¿ðŸŽ®

## Overview
**Dex - Gamifying Ecology** is a gamified, community-based flora sighting application designed to encourage data collection for environmental protection initiatives. Inspired by PokÃ©mon and the PokÃ©dex, this project combines the power of gamification and AI to make ecological data collection engaging and educational.

Users can:
- Capture images of plants.
- Use AI to identify plant species.
- Generate fictional PokÃ©mon characters based on plant characteristics.
- Track sightings, explore a PokÃ©dex-style interface, and compete on leaderboards.

## Features
### Core Functionalities
1. **Sign-Up and Login System**: Create and manage user accounts securely.
2. **Flora Identification**: Capture plant images and identify species using AI.
3. **PokÃ©mon Generation**: Generate fictional PokÃ©mon based on plant characteristics.
4. **Pokedex View**: Explore collected PokÃ©mon-like entries.
5. **Leaderboards**: Compete with others to track contributions.
6. **Map View**: Visualize plant sightings on an interactive map.
7. **Export Sightings**: Download location-based data in JSON format.
8. **Card Printouts**: Generate PokÃ©mon-like cards for individual sightings.

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Strong Security**: Encrypted passwords and session tokens.

## Project Architecture
The application is built using:
- **Spring Boot**: Backend framework for API management and database operations.
- **External APIs**: For plant identification, PokÃ©mon generation, and mapping:
  - PlantNet API: Species identification.
  - Google Cloud AI API: PokÃ©mon data generation.
  - OpenAI DALL-E API: Generative art for PokÃ©mon characters.
  - Google Maps API: Map-based visualization of sightings.

### Database Design
The SQL database is designed with 10 interconnected tables to manage users, plant sightings, PokÃ©mon data, and leaderboard rankings.
